Linux config files

- ~/.zshrc -> zsh config file. just change the theme option, including zsh-autosuggestion and zsh-highlighting;
- ~/.(g)vimrc -> (g)vim config file on Linux;(I changed my os to Archlinux, with vim 8.2, so I use coc.vim and vim-airline instead of neocomplete and vim-powerline);
- init.vim -> neovim config file(Now I use vim 8.2 instead).
- _(g)vimrc -> (g)vim config files on Windows.
- ~/.vimrc.bundles -> (g)vim plugins managed by bundle(Only on unix based system).
- config -> i3wm config file with font awesome icon-font; Be careful about the auto startup programs;(Mine is in ~/.config/i3/)
- blurlock -> i3lock shell to exec when press Mod+l(You can bind this to other keys.);(in /usr/local/bin/) I use ``dm-tool lock`` to lock screen instead.
- .i3status.conf/.i3block.conf -> i3status/i3blocks config file.(Mine is in ~/.config/i3/)   Now I use py3status instead.
At last, I'd like to show my screencast after I've done all the configurations.
